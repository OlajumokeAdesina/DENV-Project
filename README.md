This repository contains information on the code used in my first bioinformatics project

**The objective of this project was to demonstrate lead optimisation in computational drug discovery by incorporating Machine Learning. The models used in this project are the Support Vector Machine and Binary Logistic Regression models. The models were used to predict the bioactivity class (DV) of the molecules using the Lipinski Descriptors as IVs**

This was my first attempt at a bioinformatics project and I welcome any constructive feedback.
